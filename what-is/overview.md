# Overview

## Intro

DeFi Basket allows you to compose your portfolio with different assets and build it with a single transaction. You may allocate diversified types of assets, like tokens, liquidity pools tokens, protocol vaults, or even NFTs.

In this section we'll introduce you to our basic functionalities and characteristics, like copying, creating, and modifying a portfolio.&#x20;

## Copy a Portfolio or Create your Own

Our product allows you to create your portfolio in two different ways:

**Discover and copy a portfolio**

Through a list of portfolios already created you're able to find the portfolio that matches your expectation regarding possible returns and risk appetite. Once you find and select a portfolio, you're able to copy that asset allocation and generate your own portfolio. Your portfolio is under your custody and only you can change it.&#x20;

**Create your own portfolio from scratch**

If you already know what and how you want to invest, you may use DeFi Basket to save yourself time and effort to implement your trade with a single transaction. You simply select the assets to perform your allocation, deposit your funding and approve the transaction. Important to notice that the assets listed in our tool are those available on the protocols already integrated (see [below](overview.md#listed-assets) for more details).

## Maintain a Portfolio

After you implement your portfolio via cloning or creating your own, you might check its performance via the [My Portfolios](https://www.defibasket.org/my-portfolios) page. There you will be able to check the actual returns, implement changes and withdraw your position.

## Protocols Integration

Only assets from integrated protocols are available for you to invest in through DeFi Basket. The integration makes assets from selected protocols available for you to build your allocation. The mechanism used for that is called [Bridge](../technical-ref/bridges/).&#x20;

We have two different types of integrations:

**Vault integrations**

Usually refer to protocols where we deposit tokens, usually to earn transaction fees and rewards. Examples are liquidity pools from Quickswap and liquidity mining vaults from Harvest or Autofarm.

**Swap integrations**

These are mostly to allow our mechanism of a single transaction to work. For us to get to the point where we are able to deposit in a liquidity mining protocol like pools at Quickswap or vault at Harvest, we must perform several swaps from your deposit token to the desired allocation tokens.&#x20;

Therefore, you will only be able to select assets listed within DeFi Basket from the protocols that we have already integrated. Soon you will be able to vote and participate in our community to select the next integrations.&#x20;

As of March 2022, the following protocols have been integrated: Aave, Apeswap, Autofarm, Harvest, Quickswap, Dfyn, and Balancer. Our goal is to achieve 20 integrations soon.
