Click on **Copy Portfolio**, then select the amount of MATIC you want to invest in your copy. After inputting this value, click on **Preview Transaction**. The operations that will be done to generate the portfolio **** will be shown, and you can finish copying the portfolio by clicking on the <mark style="color:blue;">**Copy Portfolio**</mark> button.

## How to create a portfolio?

If there is no portfolio you would like to copy, you also have the option to set the desired allocations in our UI and to buy them with just one click. You can do it [here](https://www.defibasket.org/create).

First, click on **Create**. In this screen, you will be able to select the assets that will be included in your portfolio and their proportions (in USD). We support integration with **Aave**, **Autofarm** and many **ERC20** tokens, and you can filter the assets based on its type. If an asset is not present in the asset list, but you want us to include it, [send us a message](mailto:hi@defibastket.org)! :smile:

After this step is done, click on **Next Step** and select the token which you want to deposit to initialize the portfolio and how much you would like to deposit. Then, click on **Next Step**.

The operations that will be done to generate the portfolio **** will be shown, and you can finish creating the portfolio by clicking on the <mark style="color:blue;">**Create Portfolio**</mark> button.
