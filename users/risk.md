# Risk

## Untrusted bridges

Bridge calls have complete control over your wallet funds, so the main risk factor we have mapped is this one.

#### How to know if a Bridge is trusted:

Check a list of trusted bridges.

## Smart contract risk

IndexPool is currently on an unaudited version. Code is public on [github](https://github.com/indexpool/indexpool-contracts) and we expect an audit by Q4 2021.

## DeFi protocol risk

Every action on a bridge linking to a DeFi protocol carries all the risk embeded in that protocol, be it smart contract risk, risk of liquidation at a loss, or simply price risk.
