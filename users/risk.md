# Risk

## Untrusted bridges

Bridge calls have complete control over your wallet funds. One easy way to avoid using unstrusted bridges is by interacting with the IndexPool protocol though indexpool.org and not adding any custom bridges into the app. 

#### How to know if a Bridge is trusted:

For more advanced users, here is a list of trusted bridges.

## Smart contract risk

IndexPool is currently on an unaudited version. Code is public on [github](https://github.com/indexpool/indexpool-contracts) and we expect an audit by Q4 2021.

## DeFi protocol risk

Every action on a DeFi protocol carries all the risk embeded in that protocol, be it smart contract risk, risk of liquidation at a loss, or simply price risk.

We are working only with protocols that have been deemed secure and that have gone through audits and that have significant assets locked into it, meaning that there is a huge incentive to hack it, and no one has done it yet.
