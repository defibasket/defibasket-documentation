# Incentives

## Earning IndexPool tokens

IndexPool will have an ERC20 token that will govern the protocol DAO. The vast majority of this token will be distributed to the community through incentives to use the platform.

To earn IndexPool tokens you need to use IndexPool, you received some X amount based on the TVL you have locked into the platform, and some other amounts that will depend on how many people you have invited to the platform, and how much money those people brought in.
