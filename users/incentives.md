# Incentives

## Earning IndexPool tokens

IndexPool will have an ERC20 token that will govern the protocol DAO. The vast majority of this token will be distributed to the community through incentives to use the platform.

To earn IndexPool tokens you need to use IndexPool, you received some X amount based on the TVL you have locked into the platform, and some other amounts that will depend on how many people you have invited to the platform, and how much money those people brought in.

## Actions that earn tokens

1. **Total value locked** - The more you deposit the more you earn
2. **Bring users to the platform** - Users that arrive through IndexPool through one of your portfolios / links will earn you tokens based on their TVL
3. **Get existing users to invest in your portfolio** - If existing users find and copy your portfolio on IndexPool you will earn tokens.
