# Swaps

## How swaps are made?

Currently all swaps `(ERC20 -> ERC20)` are done on QuickSwap using WMATIC, USDC, USDT, WETH and QUICK as possible intermediaries for the routes.

## How swaps will be made?

For Q4 of 2021 we plan to add a smart routing feature, which will execute swaps accross a few different DEXes, not unlike of what DEX aggregators \(1inch\) do at this point in time.
