# Swaps

## How swaps are made?

Currently all swaps `(ERC20 -> ERC20)` are done on QuickSwap using `WMATIC`, `USDC`, `USDT`, `WETH` and `QUICK` as possible intermediaries for the routes.

## How swaps will be made?

We will soon add routing using the QuickSwap SDK and for Q4 of 2021 we will add a smart routing feature, which will execute swaps accross a few different DEXes, not unlike of what DEX aggregators like 1inch do.
