# Portfolio NFT

## Why a portfolio NFT?

Building a portfolio manually produces a non-fungible result because every portfolio is slightly different as it depends on execution prices, stake generating different yields over time depending on stake dates, etc.

As portfolios are non-fungible, using an NFT to represent them is the natural choice of architecture.

## Advantages of NFT architecture

If you have 1.34253 ETH in your portfolio, you will be guaranteed to have exactly this amount in your portfolio, as it won't be shared in a Pool and exposed to some kind of rebalancing logic.

### Wallet

An NFT allows us to create an Wallet tied to each NFT, which is an address that owns all funds relative to that NFT. This architecture also easily enables the NFT owner to access airdrops, yields in different and unexpected tokens and also makes it much more robust in terms of funds being hacked by other users, because you are the only user that can access funds.
