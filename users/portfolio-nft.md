# Portfolio NFT

## What is an NFT? 

An NFT is basically any token that is non-fungible, which means it is differentiable from other tokens. 

## Why a portfolio NFT?

Building a portfolio manually produces a non-fungible result because every portfolio is slightly different as it depends on execution prices, stake generating different yields over time depending on stake dates...

As portfolios are non-fungible by definition, using an NFT to represent them is the natural choice of architecture.

## Advantages of NFT architecture

Every NFT has it is own address in the blockchain which owns that NFT portfolio funds. If you have 1.34253 ETH in your portfolio, you will be guaranteed to have exactly this amount in your portfolio, as it won't be shared in a Pool and exposed to some kind of rebalancing logic.

This architecture also easily enables the NFT owner to access airdrops, yields in different and unexpected tokens.How are funds safe?
