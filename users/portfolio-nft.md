# Portfolio NFT

## What is a Portfolio NFT?

An NFT is basically any token that is non-fungible, which means it is differentiable from other tokens. Building a portfolio manually produces a non-fungible, because every portfolio is at least slightly different depending on execution prices, stake dates, generating different yields over time.

## How are funds safe?

Every NFT has it is own address in the blockchain which  own the portfolio funds. If you have 1.34253 ETH in your portfolio, you will be guaranteed to have exactly this amount in your portfolio, as it won't be shared in a Pool and exposed to some kind of rebalancing logic.
