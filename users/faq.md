# FAQ

## Is IndexPool a liquidity pool?

No. IndexPool is a secure crypto-portfolio builder and manager that helps you navigate through the DeFI farms of yield üë®üèª‚Äçüåæ, liquidity pools, lending pools or any other DeFi components.

## Is my NFT Portfolio's Wallet the same as my Metamask wallet?

No, while both can be used  to store ETH (MATIC) and ERC20 tokens, your IndexPool wallet enables you to batch in a single transaction the many transactions that you would need to do for the same operation in your Metamask wallet.&#x20;

For a more technical reference, your Metamask wallet is an [externally owned account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) (EOA). Your IndexPool wallet is a smart contract.

## Can I sell my Portfolio NFT on OpenSea?

Yes, and in any marketplace that supports ERC721 standard. However, **note that doing this you are transferring the ownership of your portfolio to the buyer of the NFT! **This means that you will lose access to your NFT Portfolio's Wallet and the NFT buyer will have complete access to the funds in this Wallet.
