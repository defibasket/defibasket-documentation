# IndexPool

## CreatePortfolio

Mints a new NFT and allocates deposited funds to this new NFT. Deposited funds can either be ERC20 tokens or ETH. 

| Input Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| inputs | ERC20 token addresses and amounts that will enter the contract |
| bridgeAddresses | Addresses of deployed bridge contracts |
| bridgeEncodedCalls | Encoded calls to be passed on to delegate calls |

```javascript
function createPortfolio(
    IPDataTypes.TokenData calldata inputs,
    address[] calldata bridgeAddresses,
    bytes[] calldata bridgeEncodedCalls
) payable external;
```

## DepositPortfolio

Adds more funds into an existing NFT and rearrange allocation inside the portfolio. Deposited funds can either be ERC20 tokens or ETH. _Only the NFT owner can add funds into the NFT._

| Input Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| nftId | NFT Id that will have funds deposited into |
| inputs | ERC20 token addresses and amounts that will enter the contract |
| bridgeAddresses | Addresses of deployed bridge contracts |
| bridgeEncodedCalls | Encoded calls to be passed on to delegate calls |

```javascript
function depositPortfolio(
        uint256 nftId,
        IPDataTypes.TokenData calldata inputs,
        address[] calldata bridgeAddresses,
        bytes[] calldata bridgeEncodedCalls
    ) payable external;
```

## EditPortfolio

Rearrange allocation inside the portfolio. You can't deposit or withdraw funds with this function, just rearrange whatever is inside. _\(The bridges would be capable to withdraw funds to accounts different than your own, so be sure to use only trusted bridges\)._

| Input Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| nftId | NFT Id that will have funds deposited into |
| bridgeAddresses | Addresses of deployed bridge contracts |
| bridgeEncodedCalls | Encoded calls to be passed on to delegate calls |

```javascript
function editPortfolio(
        uint256 nftId,
        address[] calldata bridgeAddresses,
        bytes[] calldata bridgeEncodedCalls
    ) external;
```

## WithdrawPortfolio

Withdraws funds from the portfolio after rearranging allocation \(optional\). 

| Input Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| nftId | NFT Id that will have funds deposited into |
| outputs | ERC20 token address and percentages that will exit the contract |
| outputEthPercentage | Percentage of ETH in portfolio that will exit the contract  \(100000 = 100%\) |
| bridgeAddresses | Addresses of deployed bridge contracts |
| bridgeEncodedCalls | Encoded calls to be passed on to delegate calls |

```javascript
function withdrawPortfolio(
        uint256 nftId,
        IPDataTypes.TokenData calldata outputs,
        uint256 outputEthPercentage,
        address[] calldata bridgeAddresses,
        bytes[] calldata bridgeEncodedCalls
    ) external;
```
