# ISwap

## FromETHToToken

Swaps from ERC20 token to ERC20 token. _Please note that function is not payable but it uses the Wallet ETH balance for the swap._

| Input Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| amountInPercentage | Percentage of the balance of input ETH \(Matic\) that will be swapped |
| amountOutMin | Minimum amount of the output token required to execute swap |
| path | The swap route determined by the path. The first element of path is the input token, the last is the output token, and any intermediate elements represent intermediate pairs to trade through \(if, for example, a direct pair does not exist\). |

```javascript
function tradeFromETHToToken(
        uint256 amountInPercentage,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path
    ) external;
```

## FromTokenToETH

Swaps from ERC20 token to ETH \(Matic\).

| Input Name | Description |

        uint256 amountInPercentage,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path
    ) external;
