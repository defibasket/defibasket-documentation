# Getting Started

## What is IndexPool?

IndexPool is a **DeFi portfolio sharing protocol,** which means you can build portfolios of investments in multiple DeFi protocols in a single transaction and share this portfolios with others.

Currently, users can participate:

* create their own portfolios
* share portfolios they have created so other people can easily replicate it
